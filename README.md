**Pagination**

This project aims to enhance the usability of a web page that displays too much information all at once. The problem of long lists making for a poor user experience is solved using a popular web development technique called "pagination."

The project follows the important development principle of "progressive enhancement," where JavaScript is added to enhance the web page without making it dependent on the JavaScript.

To achieve this, the code takes a default list of 54 students and breaks it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, buttons are added programmatically to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

The pagination solution is dynamic, meaning it works for any list containing any number of items.
