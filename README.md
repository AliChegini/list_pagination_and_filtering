This project, enhances the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, this project uses a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

While making these improvements, an important development principle known as "progressive enhancement" is practiced. Which in this case means JavaScript is added to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon the JavaScript.

With "progressive enhancement" in mind, the code take this default list of 54 students and break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, buttons are added programmitcally to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

Pagination solution should be dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items.
